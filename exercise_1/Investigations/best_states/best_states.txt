To determine the answer to this question, I had taken the best hospitals table that was created using the best_hospitals.sql, and 
averaged the TPS_score over the state. Whichever state had yielded the highest average for TPS score was the model for state that had highest care.
The table below in descending order displays in descending order the states that showed the highest quality of care, using the average tps score as the measure. 

State   Average TPS Score  Rank
DC           155.554         1
RI           146.103         2    
NC           140.481         3     
SC           139.064         4    
NH           137.538         5      
MA           137.477         6       
DE           137.175         7    
ME           137.115         8     
GA           135.888         9
