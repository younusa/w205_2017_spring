I had only considered data from the timely and effective procedures table to generate my answers to this question, since the question asked
which procedures saw the most variability across hospitals. I had used standard deviation, variance, and range to attempt to measure variability.
However, when I had first outputted data using these three functions, I noticed that the range of some of the measures were much greater than the range
of other measures, which means it is unwise to compare variability just due to variance, since some measures operate under a wider scale than others. Therefore,
to account for the large range in some of the measures, I had divided the variance of each measure by the mean of each measure across all hospitals 
and used that output as the "Adjusted Variation" to determine variability of measures across all hospitals.
The following table shows the measures that varied the most between hospitals in descending order.

It can be seen that ED_1b has the largest variance and therefore, it is easy to claim it to be the measure that experienced the largest variability
but when the measure is divided by the average of the measure, its adjusted variance falls below ED_2b. Therefore, the measure that experienced the largest
variability between hospitals is ED_2b.
