To answer this question, I had used a modified definition total performance score (TPS) as a measure of consistent high-quality care on different measures.
I had then ranked in descending order the hospitals which demonstrated high-quality care using this metric. 
The definition of TPS Score is described in the link below.

https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/data/total-performance-scores.html

Because the task prompt did not include a Safety Domain or a Efficieny and Cost Domain, as is required in the definition of TPS in the aforementioned link,
I had instead scaled up the clinical care domain and the HCAHPS Score such that the clinical care Domain accounted for  75% 
and the HCAHPS patient experience score accounted for 25% of the total TPS score. Also, I had used six measures 
to define clinical care, three from the timely and effective procedures table, (IMM-2 (Preventive Care), PC-01 (Pregnancy and Delivery Care) and OP-20 (Door to diagnostic eval),
and three from the readmissions table, MORT_30_AMI (30-day Acute Myocardial infarction mortality rate), Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate,
and Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate. The following table displays the hospital in descending order of TPS Score.

The reason this method is justified is because hospitals with the highest TPS Scores will have also shown consistently high scores for the measures that I have
used to define the TPS Score.
