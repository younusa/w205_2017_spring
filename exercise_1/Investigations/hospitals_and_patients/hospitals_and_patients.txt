-Correlation between average scores for each procedure and patient survey responses  
In order to answer this question, I used the corr() function. In order to use the corr() function, I calculated the average score for all procedures for each 
hospital in the timely and effective care data and attempted to correlate that with the HCAHPS Patient experience of care score for each hospital. 

correlation between average hospital procedural score and survey score-0.312

There is a negative correlation between average procedural score for each hospital and patient survey responses, which suggests that
hospitals that had a low average score for procedural score seemed to be favorable for patients and vice versa. 


-Correlation between procedural score for each procedure in timely and effective care and patient survey responses.
In order to answer this question, I used the corr() function. In order to use the corr() function, I tested for correlation for the score for each procedure
for each hospital to the patient care score for that hospital. If there truly was a correlation between the two values, they would vary together and we would see a 
positive correlation between a procedural score and the patient_care_score.

correlation between meaasure measure ED_1b and survey score = -0.404
correlation between meaasure measure ED_2b and survey score = -0.377
correlation between meaasure measure IMM_2 and survey score = 0.037
correlation between meaasure measure IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT and survey score = 0.114
correlation between meaasure measure OP_1 and survey score = 0.105
correlation between meaasure measure OP_18b and survey score = -0.313
correlation between meaasure measure OP_2 and survey score = 0.008
correlation between meaasure measure OP_20 and survey score = -0.175
correlation between meaasure measure OP_21 and survey score = -0.204
correlation between meaasure measure OP_22 and survey score = -0.166
correlation between meaasure measure OP_23 and survey score = -0.012

correlation between meaasure measure OP_5 and survey score = -0.143
correlation between meaasure measure PC_01 and survey score = -0.017
correlation between meaasure measure STK_4 and survey score = 0.013
correlation between meaasure measure VTE_5 and survey score = 0.067
correlation between meaasure measure VTE_6 and survey score = -0.059


The output for the correlation command reveals that there is no strong correlation between any of the procedural scores and the patient care score. 
The strongest negative correlation was seen between ED_1b ("Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients") 
and ED_2b ("Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients"), which strangely suggests that the greater the time each patient stayed in the ED,
the better the better patient score.
